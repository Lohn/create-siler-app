## How-to

### `bootstrap.php`
Is a good place to startup your application, things like database connections, dependency injection containers, setups etc.

### `index.php`
Is called on each request, is a good place for routes and things that depends on the current request.

### `src/`
Is where you place your application's source code, your classes, functions and consts.
